   * Initialize the chemist service by trying to create the various AWS resources
   * that are required to operate. Once complete, execute the init.
   *
   * There are a couple of important things to note here:
   * 1. whilst chemist will try to create an SNS topic with the specified name
   *    this still needs to be connected with your ASGs in whatever deployment
   *    configuration you happen to be using (e.g. cloudformation). This is
   *    inherently out-of-band for chemist, so we just "create" the SNS topic
   *    to ensure chemist has the best chance of initializing correctly. Without
   *    the aforementioned external configuration, you wont ever get any lifecycle
   *    events, and subsequently no immediate monitoring.
   *
   * 2. Given that SQS is basically a mutable queue, it does not play well when
   *    there are multiple chemist instances running. In an effort to isolate ourselves
   *    from this, the expectation is that you would be launching chemist with
   *    cloudformation and specifying the relevant queue as an output of your template.
   *    Doing this means that every deployment you do has a its own, isolated mutable
   *    queue to work with, and when the CFN stack is deleted, the queue will be too.
