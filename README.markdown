# Funnel

## DEPRECATED PROJECT ##

*Funnel* has been officially deprecated and is no longer maintained. The recomended alternitive is [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) which has a similar design to *Funnel*, so migration is fairly straight-forward.

## Versioning

Funnel operates an automated release system. Any merges to master produce a usable release provided the tests pass. The policy is as follows *<breaking>.<feature>.<patch>* where features are source compatible, and patches are binary compatible.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome; please send a pull request or raise an issue as appropriate.

All development and test phase logging controls are configured from the `logback-test.xml` files the `etc` directory in the root of the project. Likewise, all development configuration files are checked into the `etc` folder to ensure that local development and testing configurations never accidentally make it into a certified release.
